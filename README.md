# kickstarter-analysis-
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### **Challenge**

Outcomes Based on Goals:

Louise's kickstarter is a play, therefore we should be looking and filtering the data based on play kickstarters. The Number and percentage of Successful, Failed, and Canceled play projects were calculated in the ranges of goals. With the data, below is the line graph created.

Conclusions:
1) plays have a very low chance of being canceled. Based on the data, no mater what the goal may be, no play projects were canceled. 
2) Plays have a higher chance of being successful with a goal of less than 1000. 
3) Plays have a higher chance of failing with a goal of greater than 45000. 

Outcomes Based on Launch Date:

Theater outcome based on month launch date. The information was found using pivot tables.

Conclusions:
1) Theater projects are most successful with the launch month of May and June. 
2) Theater projects start to decline (negative trend) in sucessful projects from the peak launch month of May. 
3) The least sucessful launch months are near the end of the year - November and December. 

**limitations of the dataset and suggestions for additional tables of graphs**
Though the dataset gives indications of whether a campaign was successful or failed, it does not give details on
said failure or success. Any additional recommendations on how to prevent failure or success is purely based on
the pledged amount/ goal amount/ month launch. Helpful additional information would be (but not limited to):
  - Average size of pledge for each successful & unsuccessful for every campaign
  - Number of pledges for each successful & unsuccessful campaign

Additional ways of looking at the data with the data given could include, but are not limited to:
  - Average length of campaign vs success/failure ratio
  - more accurate and the exact time of month
